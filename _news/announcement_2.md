[https://www.imbesideyou.com/english](I'm beside you) organized at IIT-Hyderabad. Almost 50 teams participated in the hackathon. 


***


The task was to classify face images as Smile, No-Smile and Fake-Smile. I participated as a team with one of my friends - Puneet Mangla. The task was difficult, hence we structed our approach as a culmination of several components. The components were:

<ul>
    <li> A task specific modification to input </li>
    <li> Using newer optimization methods </li>
    <li> Recent augmentation methods </li>
    <li> Countering class imbalance with over-sampling </li>
</ul>

Many more components could have been tried if the time was more.

Finally, we won the Grand Cash Prize of ₹ 25K. 


It was a great experience, with quite unexpected prize. Hope to see `I' m beside you` at IIT-H again with another hackathon.
