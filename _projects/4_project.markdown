[Trax](https://github.com/google/trax){:targets="\_blank"} is a recent effort by Google Brain Team for creating a Deep Learning Framework using [Jax](https://opensource.google/projects/jax){:targets="\_blank"}. 



***
Jax and Trax differ are quite different from PyTorch, Tensorflow or any other Deep Learning Framework. Jax/Trax follow a pure Numpy-Python based syntax. You can simply play with tensors as numpy arrays and still keep track of your computational graph. 

***
Not only syntax, but Jax/Trax are found to be faster than any other framework.

I contributed a Semantic Segmentation example for Trax. Here is the [link](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/master/trax/examples/semantic_segmentation.ipynb) to the notebook. 

***
Currently, the Trax community is quite new. However there has been some recent surge in contributors due to the popular Transformer and Reformer implementation in Trax. I believe, the community will grow much rapidly with time as google starts distributing more code bases in Jax/Trax. 

Personally, I feel Trax community has worked more on NLP and hence needed some tools in the Vision domain. Hence, I choose Semantic segmentation as my target. 

Trax needs more tools for vision. For example, there are no image augmentation methods implemented.

Thanks to `Lukasz Kaiser` for reviewing the code.
