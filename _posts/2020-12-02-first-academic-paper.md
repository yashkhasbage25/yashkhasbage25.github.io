Too long story. I will summarize it in few points. 

* It was quite long effort after several failures. 

* The work almost went for 3 semesters. 

* Semester 1 was quite heavy and sincere work. Heavy brain storming with Prof. Vineeth, Ravi and Rahul.

* We brought the paper to a good level and submitted it to IJCAI. 

* It did not get through. 

* Sem 1 + 1/2 finishes.

* We improved it further and submitted it to CIKM. 

* CIKM could not accept it as it had no appropriate reviewers for the topic. 

* Semester 2 + summer finishes.

* We improved it further.

* Submitted it to AAAI-2021.

* Finally got it accepted before the end of semester 3. 

Here are details to the paper:
