I am a CSE undergrad at IIT Hyderabad. My interests are wide: Deep Learning, Sanatana Dharma and Sanskrit. 

I consider myself fortunate to be a member of Machine Learning and Vision Group at IITH (guided by [Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/){:target="\_blank"}). Mostly, I like theoretical sides of Neural Networks. With the applications side, I work on vision applications. Further, I got opportunity as Summer Research Intern at Adobe MDSR Labs, Noida (2020) and IBM Labs, Banglore (2019). Recently, my work with [Adepu Ravi Shankar](https://ravisankaradepu.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} got published at [AAAI-2021](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/){:target="\_blank"}. Currently, I am working on Memorization in Neural Networks. 

I am recently attracted towards Sanatana Dharma and Sanskrit. I like reading [Puranas](/mudgala/) and Shastras. Exploring Laukika literature is paced slow for now. With support of Samskrita Bharati, IIT-H faculties and several students, we successfully hosted basic Sanskrit courses at IITH.
